# Protein Logos

Logos using amino acid alphabets.

## Default Protein Logo

**A default protein logo colors amino acids by chemical properties.**

This logo shows the helix-turn-helix motif of the catabolite activator protein (CAP) family of DNA binding proteins. By default, LogoJS renders protein logos with amino acids colored by chemical properties: acidic is red, basic is blue, and non-polar is black. When rendering the logo, the columns in the weight matrix are ordered alphabetically, starting with A (alanine).

## Extended Amino Acid Symbol Set

**A protein logo can use extra symbols to represent indistighuishable N/D (B) and Q/E (Z).**

In some cases, asparagine and aspartic acid cannot be distinguished and must be represented as B. Likewise, when glutamine and glutamic acid cannot be distinguished a Z may be used. LogoJS protein logos support these symbols too, colored gold by default. When rendering the logo, B is the second position (index 1) in the matrix, and Z is the final position.
