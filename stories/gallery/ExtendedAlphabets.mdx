# Extended Alphabets

This gallery illustrates the use of custom alphabets in logos. RNA logos can be rendered with 1-2 lines of code, and custom alphabets can be created with just a few more. LogoJS uses a custom font which supports upper case letters, lower case letters, and the digits 0-9, but you can design custom glyphs and use them in your logos too.

## RNA Logo

**A logo can use an RNA alphabet.**

LogoJS supports RNA logos by default as shown here. The default coloring mimics that of DNA, and the matrix order in the code is alphabetical (A, C, G, U).

## CpG methylation

**A DNA logo can be extended to show CpG methylation.**

A DNA logo may be extended to use the symbols M and W to represent CpG methylation on the plus and minus strands, respectively. This logo illustrates the use of a custom alphabet to render such a logo. Note in the code that the columns in the matrix correspond to A, C, G, T, M, then W; this order is determined by the custom alphabet array order and does not need to be alphabetical, although it can be.

## Custom Symbols

**A logo can use any combination of upper case letters, lower case letters, and digits.**

LogoJS supports all the letters of the English alphabet, both upper case and lower case, as well as the digits 0-9. You can use any combination of these symbols in your logos by defining custom alphabets.

## Repeated Symbols

**A logo can use the same symbol more than once with different colors.**

If you need to, you can repeat the same symbol multiple times with different colors. This might be useful if, for example, you want to render some portion of your sequence with a darker color scheme or gray it out to emphasize a region of lesser or different biological importance. In the code, the order of the columns in the matrix corresponds to the order of the colors in the custom alphabet array.
