# Render Modes

The `Logo` component can render logos in a variety of modes.

These are specified by the `mode` prop, which can be one of the following values: `INFORMATION_CONTENT`, `FREQUENCY` or `RAW`.

The default mode is `INFORMATION_CONTENT`.

## Information content

In this mode, the height of each letter in the logo is proportional to the information content of that letter at that position in the sequence.

The y-axis of the logo represents the information content in bits, which will go from 0 to log base 2 of the number of symbols in the alphabet.

```jsx
import { DNALogo } from "logomakerjs";

export const CTCFLogo = (props) => <DNALogo data={...} type="PPM" mode="INFORMATION_CONTENT" />;
```

<Canvas of={DNALogos.CAPMotifIC} />

## Frequency

In this mode, the height of each letter in the logo is proportional to the frequency of that letter at that position in the sequence.

The y-axis of the logo represents the frequency of the symbol at that position. This will range from 0 to 1.

```jsx
import { DNALogo } from "logomakerjs";

export const CTCFLogo = (props) => <DNALogo data={...} type="PPM" mode="FREQUENCY" />;
```

<Canvas of={DNALogos.CTCFMotifFrequency} />

## Raw

In this mode, the height of each letter is displayed exactly as it is in the input data.

```jsx
import { DNALogo } from "logomakerjs";

export const CTCFLogo = (props) => <DNALogo data={...} type="VALUES" mode="RAW" />;
```

<Canvas of={DNALogos.Bigwig} />
