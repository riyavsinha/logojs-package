# Annotations

The `Logo` component can render logos with annotations. Annotations are specified by the `annotations` prop, which takes in an array of Annotation components.

## Built-In Annotations

### Position Range Box

Component Link: [PositionRangeBox](?path=/docs/annotations-positionrangebox--docs)

The `PositionRangeBox` annotation is a box that spans a range of positions in the sequence. It is useful for highlighting regions of interest in the sequence.

The only required props for `PositionRangeBox` are `startPos` and `endPos`, which specify the start and end positions of the box, respectively.

```jsx
import { DNALogo, PositionRangeBox } from "logomakerjs";

export const DNALogo = (props) => (
  <DNALogo
    data={...}
    type="PPM"
    annotations={[
      <PositionRangeBox startPos={1} endPos={4} />,
    ]}
  />
);
```

<Canvas of={PositionRangeBox.Default} />

## Custom Annotations

Adding custom annotations can be complex due to the need to calculate the SVG position of the annotation, including taking into account the offset due to axes, and any user-added padding.

LogoMakerJS exposes all the necessary information to calculate the position of the annotation in the `LogoContext` object, which can be accessed by any Annotation component.

**If there is a specific annotation you would like to see implemented, please let us know by opening an issue on the [LogoMakerJS GitHub repository](https://github.com/riyavsinha/logomakerjs/issues)**. We would be happy to help implement use cases that are common to the community.

### Logo Context

The `LogoContext` object contains the following properties:

- `glyphWidth`: The width of each glyph in the logo. This is useful for calculating the x-position of the annotation relative to the logo. In general, the x-position of the annotation should be calculated as `startPos * glyphWidth`.
- `height`: The height of the logo. This is useful for calculating the y-position of the annotation relative to the logo.
- `values`: The values used to render the logo. This is useful for calculating the y-position of the annotation relative to the actual heights in the logo.
- `maxValue`: The maximum value in the logo
- `minValue`: The minimum value in the logo
- `transform`: The transform applied to the logo accounting for axes and padding. This is useful for moving to the correct start of the `PlainLogo` component that you may want to annotate.

If you require additional information to calculate the position of your annotation, please let us know by opening an issue on the [LogoMakerJS GitHub repository](https://github.com/riyavsinha/logomakerjs/issues), or feel free to open a pull request with the necessary changes.

For an example of how to use the `LogoContext` object, see the [PositionRangeBox](https://github.com/riyavsinha/logomakerjs/blob/main/src/components/annotations/PositionRangeBox.tsx#L29) annotation implementation.
