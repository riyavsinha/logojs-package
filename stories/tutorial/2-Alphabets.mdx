# Alphabets

An `Alphabet` is an ordered list of characters that can be used to represent a sequence. The order of the characters in the alphabet is important, as it determines the order of the columns in the logo. For example, if the alphabet is `['A', 'C', 'G', 'T']`, then the first column in the logo will represent the frequency of `A` at that position, the second column will represent the frequency of `C`, and so on.

## Provided Alphabets

LogoMakerJS provides a number of pre-defined alphabets for DNA, RNA, and proteins.

### DNA

```jsx
import { DNAAlphabet } from "logomakerjs";
```

<Canvas of={Alphabets.DNAAlphabetDisplay} />

### RNA

```jsx
import { RNAAlphabet } from "logomakerjs";
```

<Canvas of={Alphabets.RNAAlphabetDisplay} />

### Proteins

The standard protein alphabet contains the 22 amino acids plus B and Z
for N/D and Q/E. Acidic amino acids are red shades, basic amino acids
are blue shades, non-polar amino acids are black shades, and B and Z
are gold shades.

```jsx
import { ProteinAlphabet } from "logomakerjs";
```

<Canvas of={Alphabets.ProteinAlphabetDisplay} />

### Complete Alphabet

The `CompleteAlphabet` includes all glyphs supported by LogoMakerJS.

```jsx
import { CompleteAlphabet } from "logomakerjs";
```

<Canvas of={Alphabets.CompleteAlphabetDisplay} />

## Custom Alphabets

You can also create custom alphabets by passing an array of characters to the `Alphabet` component.

```tsx
import { A, B } from "logomakerjs";

const newAlphabet = [
  { component: A, regex: "A", color: "green" },
  { component: B, regex: "B", color: "red" },
];
```

In this example, the `newAlphabet` array contains two objects, each with a `regex` property that specifies a regular expression that matches a supported glyph in the `CompleteAlphabet`. The `component` property is optional and can be used to specify a custom component to render the glyph. The `color` property is also optional and can be used to specify a custom color for the glyph.

You may exclude the component if the regex matches a supported glyph in the `CompleteAlphabet`:

```tsx
const newAlphabet = [
  { regex: "A", color: "green" },
  { regex: "B", color: "red" },
];
```

Or, if you also are ok with the default color:

```tsx
const newAlphabet = [{ regex: "A" }, { regex: "B" }];
```
